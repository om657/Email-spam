# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements an Email Spam Detection system using machine learning techniques. It classifies emails as spam or ham (not spam) based on text features extracted from the email content. The model is trained using a labeled dataset and deployed via a Flask API for real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Deployment**: Flask API for real-time predictions.
- **Model Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-detection.git
   cd email-spam-detection

Usage
   
Web API: Send email text as input via an HTTP request to classify it.
Command Line: Run predict.py with a sample email text to classify it.
